## Code Structure

1. **backprojection.py**
   - Implementation of the Backprojection algorithm.

2. **data_generator.py**
   - Generates 2D data for testing purposes.
   - Options include loading an image, using the Shepp-Logan phantom, or generating a simple Disk object.

3. **filters.py**
   - Implementation of various filters used in tomographic image reconstruction.
   - Includes filters for Backproject Filter and Filter Backprojection algorithms.

4. **fourier_gridding.py**
   - Performs radial-to-cartesian interpolation on a 2D Fourier Transform.

5. **fourier_transform.py**
   - Implementation of the Fourier Transform.

6. **radon_transform.py**
   - Implementation of the Radon Transform.

7. **tutorials.ipynb**
   - Jupyter notebook demonstrating the usage of all reconstruction methods with examples and visualizations.
